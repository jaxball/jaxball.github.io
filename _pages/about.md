Hi! This is Jason - AI researcher, full-stack engineer, and tech entrepreneur. 

I am currently at DeepMind making *large language models* a reality in everyday life. My background is in computer vision, and before that security and systems, where I've designed and optimized algorithms at Google X, Lyft Level 5, Apple, Spotify, and Tencent. In my spare time, I take theoretical classes from Stanford and advise policy makers on AI safety. Besides machine learning, I've also dabbled with data, web/mobile, Internet of Things, algorithmic trading/quantitative finance, VR, crypto, among varied deep tech interests.

### Research interests
I am broadly interested in _reasoning from perception and language_, _few-shot learning_ and _multimodal representations_. <br />

### Upcoming 
Papers coming soon: self-supervised transformer multimodal attention, composition-aware captions for diffusion models, red-teaming language models, neural retrievers domain adaption, RL finetuning Question-Answering models. Feel free to reach out at jj0 [at] stanford [dot] edu.

<!-- Topics: object & pose recognition, VQA, adversarial ML, diffusion models, domain adaptation, bayesian methods, prompt-learning, neural retrievers, vision and language, self-supervised learning, video (audio) understanding, 3D vision, sensor fusion, AutoML, Edge/efficient ML.   -->

3. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
4. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
5. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
6. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
7. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
